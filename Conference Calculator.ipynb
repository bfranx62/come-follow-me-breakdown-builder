Then, I saved the columns that contain float numbers as the object 'float_cols'. I then used the regular expression pattern and function to look through those columns for all the columns that match the pattern I defined. Then I converted only those float columns that matched my pattern into integers. Finally, I display the dtypes to show the datatypes in each column of my dataframe. "
