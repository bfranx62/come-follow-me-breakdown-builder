    "The purpose of this notebook is to begin making improvements on my General Conference Breakdown program. \n",
    "\n",
    "Things I need to fix include the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "Functionality issues:\n",
    "* the calculator is printing out days after the readthrough is supposed to be finished. Currently, on these days, it prints out the start point as the paragraph after the final paragraph of the talk, and the end point as the final paragraph of the talk. \n",
    "* when exporting to a csv, special characters (like ones with accent marks) seem to be saving in something akin to unicode.\n",
    "* consider also saving the total number of paragraphs in the final breakdown, and maybe use short role instead of role.\n",
    "* make sure code can handle handle different and incorrect inputs (such as different date formats or just putting the wrong thing in as input)\n",
    "* ~~descriptions of photographs are being counted as paragraphs, throwing off the count.~~ Corrected **24 Feb 2024**\n",
    "* ~~some talks ended up having the wrong number of counted paragraphs - this could be related to the photograph descriptions, or to something else in the code.~~ Corrected **24 Feb 2024**\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency issues:\n",
    "* adjust function to save conference talks as their own information and draw information about them from it's memory, not export then re-import them. \n",
    "* adjust function to only drive to the web one time, rather than driving to the web to get information about the conference as a whole, then to navigate to it a second time to get information about each of the talks (so include the work done in the `get_talks` functions in the initial driver navigation)\n",
    "* remove unnecessary debugging print lines, implement more informative and useful ones until they are no longer needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Later features:\n",
    "* enable the function to create a breakdown regardless of any information being missing, like start or end date, number of readthroughs, etc. \n",
    "* enable the function to be able to account for \"break days\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As I work through different issues, I will use the ~~strikethrough~~ markdown to indicate that an issue in the list above has been resolved. I will also include documentation in the markdowns below explaining how I approached fixing the issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting with anything else, though, I needed to first import the necessary packages and then divide the calculator function into separate parts or stages. This will help me handle things at different steps of the process without having to go through the whole breakdown process every time, and enable me to identify easily when and where my code is getting choked up.

    "Upon trying to run the calculator above, I found that for some reason, the video/audio element was not being found, which was resulting in the function no longer being able to calculate the length of videos of these talks. I could spend a few days trying to get that up and working, but ultimately, I think that what will be easiest and simplest would be to forego any operations that require 'clicking play' and looking for the length of the video. I'll spend the rest of my time today trying to figure it out, and if I can't, I'll probably just move on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason I think I'll just move on is that this calculator was working a few months ago when I calculated out the October 2024 General Conference, but now trying to work with the same conference, it's not working, suggesting that some back-end identifiers got updated or something. Even when I tried to run the function in my `Conference Calculator 1.0` notebook, I find that it is no longer able to find the play button for the videos. This suggests that just in the last few months the html code has been updated, and if I'm going to have to rebuild this every six months to accomodate that, it's probably not worth it, especially considering the marginal level of additional accuracy using the video lengths of each talk gives. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, that's a big thing to undo, I think: setting up this calculator to no longer use the video. That will speed it up and make it simpler. And, it seems that the number of lines and paragraphs are still calculating and counting, suggesting that although the video and play button tags have been updated, the tags for the text and paragraphs have not. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think that with the last few minutes I have today, I will breakdown the first aspect of the calculator, and see what I can do about making sure it is working. As I did before, I'm going to have to modularize this, and then put it all together. "

It also, stupidly, exports the talks to my device without saving them in python's memory, and then imports them from my device to save them in python's memory. This is inefficient and time consuming.

It will also help me to get the entire calculator set up in such a way that most, if not all, of the requests for user input are concentrated at the beginning of the calculator program, rather than scattered throughout the process.

    "    This function does not get the Variance of the Predicted Log-Ratios from a dataframe containing information about a given general conference. Instead it gets the video length, paragraph length, and line length of each talk in a given general conference or set of talks. The function first copies the provided conference dataframe and saves it as a new dataframe that will be added to. It then initializes new rows for information to be populated into, and starts up a webdriver, which navigates to each url provided in the original dataframe. At each url attempts to remotely 'click' the play button, and when it successfully does so, it records the length of the video of the talk. It then finds all the paragraph elements on the page, removes captions to pictures, and then stores the number of paragraph elements as the paragraph length of the talk. Then it calculates the total number of lines in the talk and stores that as the number of lines. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The function also gathers all the text of each talk, and saves to a dictionary nuanced information about each talk, including the text and length of each paragraph. The dataframes saved to this dictionary are made SQL friendly with the incorporation of primary and foreign keys. Each dataframe is also exported as a csv to the location specified in earlier stages of the calculator. \n",

    "Great! Running the cell above and below shows that I have something awesome to be proud of. I got this all ready up to the point where, if I get nothing else done in regards to patching this calculator up, it still works, despite having modularized it. In addition to that, though, I also can be proud because I cut the run time for the whole thing basically in half, down from almost 10 minutes to just over 5. That in and of itself is a huge accomplishment. "
